# Discovery System Fix Summary

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Discovery Was Resetting All Robots ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Line 1446 in `index.html` was calling `robots.clear()` which wiped ALL existing robot data
**Fix**: Changed to mark existing robots as "checking" status instead of deleting them

### 2. Discovery Only Ran Once ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: No mechanism for continuous or repeated discovery
**Fixes**: 
- Added "Continuous Discovery" button that runs discovery every 30 seconds
- Added "Update Discovery" button for manual updates without clearing
- Discovery now properly merges new robots with existing ones

### 3. State Not Preserved Between Runs ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Each discovery completely replaced all robot data
**Fix**: Implemented proper merge logic that:
- Updates existing robots with new information
- Adds newly discovered robots
- Preserves important state like device IDs, services, etc.
- Marks missing robots as offline instead of deleting them

## Key Changes Made

### In `deployment-server/static/index.html`:

1. **Removed destructive clear**:
```javascript
// OLD - Line 1446
robots.clear();  // This was destroying everything!

// NEW
robots.forEach((robot, ip) => {
    robot.status = 'checking';  // Just mark as checking
});
```

2. **Added merge logic for discovered robots**:
```javascript
// Now properly merges instead of replacing
result.fleet.robots.forEach(robot => {
    const existingRobot = robots.get(robot.ip);
    if (existingRobot) {
        // Update existing robot - preserve state
        existingRobot.status = 'online';
        // ... merge other properties
    } else {
        // Add new robot
        robots.set(robot.ip, {...});
    }
});
```

3. **Added continuous discovery**:
- New button: "Continuous Discovery" 
- Runs discovery every 30 seconds automatically
- Can be toggled on/off
- Preserves state between runs

4. **Added update discovery button**:
- "Update Discovery" button for manual refresh
- Updates without clearing existing data

## New Features Added

1. **Continuous Discovery Mode**
   - Toggle button in UI
   - Runs every 30 seconds when enabled
   - Automatically pauses when page is hidden
   - Resumes when page becomes visible

2. **State Preservation**
   - Robot IDs preserved between discoveries
   - Service status maintained
   - Camera images cached and preserved
   - Offline robots marked but not deleted

3. **Manual Update Button**
   - Update discovery without clearing
   - Preserves all existing robot data
   - Only updates changed information

## Testing

Created `test_discovery_fix.py` to verify:
- Discovery can run multiple times
- State is preserved between runs
- Robots are not cleared on subsequent discoveries

## How to Use

1. **First Discovery**: Click "Discover Robots" to find all robots
2. **Update Existing**: Click "Update Discovery" to refresh without clearing
3. **Continuous Mode**: Click "Continuous Discovery" to auto-update every 30s
4. **Manual Refresh**: Use "Manual Refresh" for staged collection

## Result

✅ Discovery now properly:
- Updates existing robots instead of resetting
- Can run continuously or on-demand  
- Preserves important state between runs
- Merges new discoveries with existing data
- Works as expected without data loss
